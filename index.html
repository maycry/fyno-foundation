            <h3>Renovation and restoration</h3>
            <p class="small">6.5 millions of Ukrainians were displaced due to the Russian invasion. Thousands of houses were destroyed.</p>
            <p class="small">Since the war is not yet over, we plan to provide financial support for efficient and comfortable short term (temporary) living for those who lost their homes.</p>
            <p class="small">Going forward we will support sustainable and eco-friendly permanent living options; partial and full restoration of schools and other educational establishments  damaged during the invasion: kindergartens, schools, universities and many more.</p>

    educated and intelligent nation, we will not let the consequences on the Russian invasion change that.</p>
            <p class="small">We plan to provide financial support and create comfortable conditions for students to continue education after returning to Ukraine;  sponsor and organize events to spread the awareness about Ukrainian history, language and culture and the consequences of the Russian genocide against Ukrainian nation.</p>
